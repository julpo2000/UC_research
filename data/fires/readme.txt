This folder stores data about the five biggest fires in the USA in 2021 according to our fire dataset. Each folder stores one of the fires. 
The textfile stores metadata about the fire from the fire dataset, the name of the tropomi data and a downloadlink to the tropomi data. 
Since the tropomi datasets are too large to put on github, we provide the downloadlink to them.

The png file holds the plot that was generated using this data.
